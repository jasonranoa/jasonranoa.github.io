### Extra Credit Project
I developed an extra credit project for the Spring 2023 MTH 228 class at Oregon State University involving the calculation of the best-fit allometric model 

$$y = a x^{k} \quad\text{ for constants } a \text{ and } k$$

given some allometric dataset $$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$$
using matrix operations.
The calculation involves linearizing the allometric model by application of $$\log(-)$$ as follows:

$$ \log(y) = \log(a) + k \log(x)$$

Here, we assume that the best-fit line (i.e. doing linear regression) for the equation above yields the best-fit allometric model.
This best-fit line can be determined by solving the following normal matrix equation:

$$ 
M^T Mx = M^T b 
$$ 

where $$M$$ and $$b$$ are matrices containing the relevant allometric data and $$x$$ is a column vector containing the coefficients of the best-fit line.

- The PDF of the handout/project description given to students is available [here](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-spring-mth-228/Extra Credit Project - Handout, MTH 228 Spring 2023.pdf).
- This project is based on the paper 
*"The Allometry of Brain Size in Mammals"* by Burger, George, Leadbetter, and Shaikh (April 2019). 
The paper is available via Oxford Academic, linked [here](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/2/276/5436908),
and a copy of the pdf is linked [here](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-spring-mth-228/The Allometry of Brain Size in Mammals, Burger et. al.pdf).
We asked students to recreate the results given in Table 1 for specific orders.
- The dataset is posted in Dryad, linked 
[here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2r62k7s).
The relevant csv file is also linked [here](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-spring-mth-228/BrainAllometry_Supplement_Data.csv).
- An example calculation of linear regression by matrices is given [here](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-spring-mth-228/Example - Linear Regression by Matrices.pdf)
