# MTH 264 Introduction to Matrix Algebra - Summer 2023
Listed below are some of the materials I've developed for the MTH 264 course I taught at Oregon State University.

### Lecture Notes.
1. [LN1A. Vectors in Rn, Vector Operations, Geometric Interpretations](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN1A. Vectors in Rn, Vector Operations, Geometric Interpretations.pdf)
1. [LN1B. Matrices](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN1B. Lecture Notes - Matrices.pdf)
1. [LN2A. Matrix Equations and Row Operations](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN2A. Matrix Equations and Row Operations.pdf)
1. [LN2B. Gaussian Elimination and Identification of Solutions](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN2B. Gaussian Elimination and Identification of Solutions.pdf)
1. [LN3A. Linear Transformations](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN3A. Linear Transformations.pdf)
1. [LN3B. Determinants](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN3B. Determinants.pdf)
1. [LN3C. Matrices of Reflection and Projection Transformations, and Properties of Determinants](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN3C. Householder Reflections and Determinants.pdf)
1. [LN4A. The Eigenvalue Problem](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN4A. The Eigenvalue Problem.pdf)
1. [LN4C. Miscellaneous Results](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN4C. Miscellaneous Results on the Eigenvalue Problem and on Inverse Matrices.pdf).
	These notes were not discussed in class but were offered as an additional resource.
1. [LN0. Introduction to Logic](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-summer-mth-264/LN0. Introduction to Logic.pdf).
	These notes were offered as an additional resource. Concepts such as the implication and its converse not being equivalent were briefly covered in class.
