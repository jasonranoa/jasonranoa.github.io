# MTH 228 Calculus and Probability for the Life Sciences
The following is an extra credit project I've developed for the MTH 228 course at Oregon State University.
The formal handout is available here:
[PDF download](/assets/teaching-materials/2023-spring-mth-228/Extra Credit Project - Handout, MTH 228 Spring 2023.pdf).

For this project, we ask students to explicitly calculate the best-fit line (i.e. by linear regression) for a certain set of points using matrix operations.
In particular, we ask students to find the least-squares solution by solving the following normal equation:

$$ 
M^T Mx = M^T b 
$$ 

where $$M$$ and $$b$$ are matrices containing the relevant allometric data and $$x$$ is a column vector containing the coefficients of the best-fit line.

The project also uses data published in the paper 
*"The Allometry of Brain Size in Mammals"* by Burger, George, Leadbetter, and Shaikh published in the Journal of Mammology.
A copy of the paper is available via Oxford Academic, linked [here](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/2/276/5436908),
and the dataset via Dryad, linked
